It is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, making it a popular choice for various applications ranging from desktop computers and servers to embedded systems.TCET Linux began in 2022 and is continuing with a strong legacy.

## ABOUT US :
The TCET Linux operating system is made up of a kernel, which is the core part responsible for managing hardware resources and providing basic services, and various software packages that make up the user-space applications and utilities. One of the key features of TCET Linux is its ability to run on a wide range of hardware architectures, from smartphones and tablets to laptops and servers.
What sets it apart from other operating systems is its open-source nature. This means that the source code of the TCET Linux kernel and most software applications that run on it are freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute. This open approach has led to a large community of developers and enthusiasts contributing to the development and improvement of it.
TCET Linux distributions, commonly referred to as "distros," are different flavors of Linux that package the Linux kernel along with various software applications and utilities to provide a complete operating system. Some popular Linux distributions include Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, CentOS, and Arch Linux, each with its own set of features and target audience.

Auto Start:
 When the "auto start" feature is enabled, it means that a device or application will automatically initiate or begin a specific action or process without requiring manual intervention from the user. For example, an "auto start" feature in a car could mean that the engine starts automatically when the ignition is turned on.

Auto Off: Similarly, "auto off" refers to a feature that automatically stops or shuts down a device or application after a certain period of inactivity or when a specific condition is met. For instance, some electronics may have an "auto off" feature to conserve energy by turning off after a period of no activity.
